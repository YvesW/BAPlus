# BA Plus
Speedrunning and leeching enhancements to Barbarian Assault

- Disable Call Flashing -> Stops the new call from flashing every time it changes
- Legacy Egg Models -> Partially recolors the icons on the eggs to make them closer to their old solid colors
- Show wave and game duration -> Duplicates functionality in the vanilla BA plugin, recommended to disable the vanilla version
- Compare wave times against goal -> Will add a goal comparison to the wave duration message
- Show wave end splits -> Compares your total run time (split) against a time of your choosing.
- Show point breakdown -> Displays misc post-game and post-wave info (eggs collected, hp vialed, wrong attacks, points gained)

**------- Split Comparisons --------**
- Run Category -> Choose the run category you would like to compare splits against, or to save a PB to (Solo Heal, Duo Heal, Leech, WR & PB, Custom)
- Save last run as PB (default hotkey: *Ctrl+Shift+O*) -> Saves the most recent run to the PB category chosen (make sure to choose a PB category)
- Save custom time as PB (default hotkey: *Ctrl+Shift+P*) -> Saves whatever times are in the custom "Wave Splits" text box to the chosen category
- Wave End Times -> Custom text box to compare your desired wave end times (choose Custom as run category)
- Wave End Splits -> Custom text box to compare your desired splits (choose Custom as run category)
--> Enter wave end times/splits as a string of times.  Example: :30,:36,:42,:42,:45,:57,1:06,1:09,1:18,1:43

If you want to update the wave end goals, use the Save custom time hotkey and attempt to save to the Custom run category
